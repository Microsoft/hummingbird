## Introduction

*Hummingbird* is a library for accelerating inference (scoring/prediction) in traditional machine learning (ML) models. It  compiles traditional ML pipelines into tensor computations, which allows users to seamlessly leverage hardware acceleration without having to re-engineer their models. 

You can use *Hummingbird* to convert your trained traditional ML models into [PyTorch](https://pytorch.org/). Currently we support a variety of tree-based classifiers and regressors.  These models include
[scikit-learn](https://scikit-learn.org/stable/) Decision Trees and Random Forest, and also [LightGBM](https://github.com/Microsoft/LightGBM) and [XGBoost](https://github.com/dmlc/xgboost) Classifiers/Regressors.

## Installation

Hummingbird was tested on Python 3.6. and 3.7 on Linux, Windows and MacOS machines.  It is recommended to use a virtual environment (See: [python3 venv doc](https://docs.python.org/3/tutorial/venv.html) or [Using Python environments in VS Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/python/environments).)
```
mkdir hummingbird
cd hummingbird
git clone https://github.com/microsoft/hummingbird.git .
python setup.py install
```

## Examples

See the [notebooks](notebooks) section for examples that demonstrate use and speedups.

In general, Hummingbird syntax is very intuitive and minimal. To run your traditional ML model on DNN frameworks, you only need to `import hummingbird` and add `to('dnn_framework')` to your code. Below is an example using a [LightGBM](https://lightgbm.readthedocs.io/en/latest/) model and [PyTorch](https://pytorch.org/) as target framework.

```python
import torch
import numpy as np
import lightgbm as lgb
import hummingbird

# Create some random data for binary classification
num_classes = 2
X = np.array(np.random.rand(100000, 28), dtype=np.float32)
y = np.random.randint(num_classes, size=100000)

# Create and train a model (LightGBM in this case)
model = lgb.LGBMClassifier()
model.fit(X, y)

# Use Hummingbird to convert the model to pytorch
model = model.to('pytorch')

# Run predictions on CPU
model.predict(X)

# Run predictions on GPU
model.to('cuda')
model.predict(X)
```
